Let's compare output of two commands:

docker inspect f55a2c6fa7ad # inspect container
docker inspect 11bf2545aa8a # inspect image

1. An image doesn't have state, and a container has.
2. A container has network settings (because it is running and operates), but an image does not.
3. In our case, the image was created from running container, and that is the reason why it's Parent attribute has the same value as container's Image attribute.

Of course there are more major differences between images and containers (presence of RW layer, running processes etc.), but based on the "docker inspect" output, we can conclude these three points.
